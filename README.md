# This Readme.md file shares what we are going to do for this project. I'm going to use DLP to look for a specific phrase: 
# "public class JavadocTest"
# Here is the code snippet: 
# public class JavadocTest {
#   // indentation and line breaks are kept 
# 
#   @SuppressWarnings
#   public List<String> generics(){
#     // '@', '<' and '>'  have to be escaped with HTML codes
#     // when used in annotations or generics
#   }
# }
